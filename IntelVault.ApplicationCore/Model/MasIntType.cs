/// Measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT) are gathered from an array of signatures (distinctive characteristics) of fixed or dynamic target sources. According to the Air Force Institute of Technology's Center for MASINT Studies and Research, MASINT is split into six major disciplines: electro-optical, nuclear, radar, geophysical, materials, and radiofrequency.[3]

/// Airborne electro-optical missile tracking MASINT
/// Tactical counter-artillery sensors
/// Infrared MASINT
/// Optical measurement of nuclear explosions
/// LASER MASINT
/// Spectroscopic MASINT
/// Hyperspectral MASINT
/// Space-based staring infrared sensors
/// Nuclear MASINT
/// Radiation survey and dosimetry
/// Space-based nuclear energy detection
/// Effects of ionizing radiation on materials
/// Geophysical MASINT
/// Weather and sea intelligence MASINT
/// Acoustic MASINT, also known as acoustical intelligence (ACOUSTINT or ACINT)
/// Seismic MASINT
/// Magnetic MASINT
/// Gravitimetric MASINT
/// Radar MASINT
